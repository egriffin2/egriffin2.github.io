# H1  7.2 README

This accidentally got set up as 7.1 the first time, so just ignore that bit up there.

This project was hell.  HOWEVER...
I actually did have a really good time with it, even when I was completely lost.  The hardest part of this for me was
that, from what I saw, there are multiple different ways to DO something, but not all of them work with the other things
you are trying to accomplish.  The other thing I encountered that frustrated me to no end was when I tried something
I thought would work and it *almost* does the right thing, but not quite. This was an incredibly frustrating project, but
also extremely satisfying when I finally got it right.
