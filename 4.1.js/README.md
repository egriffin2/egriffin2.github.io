# 4.1 README

This was a pretty easy, very fun project…up until I tried to get it onto github (again).  Going through the process of setting variables and making sure that I put them in the right places is not difficult, but it can be very confusing if I’m not paying very close attention.  I really have to work myself into the correct mindset in order to be productive when I’m working on assignments for this class.  Overall, everything went rather smoothly up until it came time to put everything on github, at which point I became
completely
and totally
lost.

Again.

Also, in the event that I do actually get this onto the homework wiki tonight, I am 99% sure that it will be wrong and I will have to re-learn how to do it properly.

Again.
