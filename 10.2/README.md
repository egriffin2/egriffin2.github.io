#  7.2 README

This assignment turned out looking really simple which frustrates me because I had no issue actually bringing data in and using
it once I got the API key to work. I was trying to get more inventive with what exactly I was doing with the data, but for
whatever reason, I could not even get an ellipse to move, despite watching several tutorial videos, looking back through past
examples, and spending a total of about 4 hours on that part of the project. It was a great learning exercise, but in the end
things still weren't working. I do however understand how to bring data into a sketch, which is good since that was pretty much
the point of this assignment.  ANYWAY...

My sketch is broken and I don't know why.
