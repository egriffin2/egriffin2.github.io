# 4.2 README

This one definitely got a little harder. The further we go, the more likely I
am to get a little bit lost within the equations. I didn't have any real
problems with this, but I did play with it quite a bit. Once I found the piece
of code I needed, I would copy it from wherever I happened to find it and then
tweak it in certain places until it was doing what I wanted it to be doing
and I could identify exactly WHY it was behaving. The GUI element was probably
the hardest of these to figure out. I understand the concept of it (or at least
I think I do) but I have to be in a very specific headspace to be able to really
grasp it and work with it efficiently.

Most importantly, I think I may have actually uploaded my homework correctly.
