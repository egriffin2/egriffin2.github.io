<H3>Blog Entry for HW 2.1</H3>

This was actually a really fun project!  I loved putting this together and had surprisingly few issues,
although getting this readme up and running is going to be an adventure. The thing I struggled with the most in the drawing
was getting the chef's mouth to look right (now I understand the concept of HALF_PI+HALF_PI). Fun homework!
