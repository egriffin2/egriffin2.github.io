<h1>Final Project - Sound in Motion</h1>
<p> My final projeect, "Sound in Motion", is a music visualizer that uses the frequency levels of several mp3 files to 
create a set of arcs that move in time with music.  Each arc in each circle is assigned a different set of frequencies:
bass, low mid, mid, high mid, or treble.  This project offers the user the chance to choose from six songs and experience 
the differences in the way each piece of music "looks".</p>
<h2>Here's a quick peek at the process from beginning to end.</h2>
