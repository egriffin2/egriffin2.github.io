# 4.2 README

First, and probably least important: I actually got all of my files onto github in the right place and saved onto the homework page without any issues whatsoever.

This was such a fun project to do, even though it fought me every step of the way. After trying and trying with exactly zero working results, I finally resorted to copying the code directly from the 6-1 instructional video given, and somehow managed to screw that up as well.  After finding the smiley face class example, things cleared up a little bit, since I had something to work off of.  From there I did my best to grasp the concept of classes and get all three of my files working together in the right way.  Modification of what I'd made was where things got tough. I managed to create separate circles that turn into squares when the mouse is held down, and now instead of the circles bouncing off the walls when they meet a boundary, they appear back in a different place. There were lots of other things that I attempted to do, but figuring out where to place the commands I wanted in a way that would not render the code useless was nearly impossible.  By 1 a.m. I thought it was probably time to call it good.

Every time I finish a homework assignment I feel a little more confident and a little more lost at the same time. For the most part I understand how to create the things I am trying to create. My problem is figuring out where to put certain parts of the code in order for them to work.
