<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p>For my final project I would like to create a music visualization piece that looks something like [these](https://w-labs.at/experiments/audioviz/)
, preferably the pulse if possible. Of course, I don't want it to be exactly like this; I'd like to include some
colors in the final product, preferably corresponding to volume (for example, if a ring of the pulse corresponded to a specific
sound within the music, the color of the pulse ring would reflect the volume of that specific sound).  Somewhat like these:

I am really hoping that [this guy's page] (https://www.patrick-wied.at/blog/how-to-create-audio-visualizations-with-javascript-html.com) will be able to help me out a little bit and that I am actually capable of doing this (I'm pretty sure I am but I'm concerned that an unexpected problem will prove me wrong).  Either way, his page looks like it will probably be a really good resource for this particular project. </p>

<h3>Sub-Problems</h3>
<p> First I'll need to find a song I need and figure out how to pull the data I need from the song so that I can use it within my piece.  I also will want to get my pulse circle set up and ready.  Next, I will have to link each individual circle of the pulse with each aspect of the song that I want to/can represent.  After that, I'll need to make sure that changes in the parts of the song that I have chosen will result in the correct movement of the parts of the pulse.  Lastly, I will need to make sure that the color of the individual pieces will reflect the volume. </p>

<h3>Work Schedule</h3>
    11/14 : Propose project.
    11/16 : Find a song JSON object online that contains data that can be used for this project.
    11/21 : Set up a pulse circle and link individual circles to the individual parts of the JSON object.
    11/23 : Get the circles moving.  Even if it isn't perfect, make sure that they are moving somewhat like they are supposed to.
    11/28 : Since this is immediately after Thanksgiving, realistically I probably won't have made a ton of progress in the days before this, but we can hope.  For now I'm going to say that I'll work more on perfecting the movement of the circles in relation to the music.
    11/30 : Movement should be done, and if not it should be getting there fairly close.
    12/5 : Movement must be completely done and perfected.  This is not the time to be messing around.
    12/7 : I'm really hoping that color doesn't ACTUALLY take me this entire week, but in case it does we're going to say that I'll at least have my colors changing, if not completely coordinated.
    12/12 : Project is due.
  For whatever reason, my links aren't working.  Good times.
